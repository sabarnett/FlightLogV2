# RC Flight Log Version 2
Anyone flying a remote control aircraft is supposed to keep a flight log showing
basic details of the flight. These details can be a paper log or can be an electronic
log, as the user prefers. The main requirement is to be able to show these details for
all flights in the pre virus two years.

This app is intended to fill the bulk of the requirements. 

It is also my first significant app built for the Apple platform, so the code may well be
overly complex or badly formed. Who knows... I'm just trying to learn.
